## About Test Task

You upload an image and then service extract primary color of this image in RGB format. For example, you upload image where priority color is yellow (this is combination of red and green), so it takes max number of R (red) or G (green) in this particular example. After deciding what color is a priority, we insert the necessary watermark (in public/images/).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Here is how looks the result of uploaded image with a watermark.
